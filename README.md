# HangMan-Game-Using-python

The Hangman project is a text-based game that allows users to play the classic game of Hangman.
The game selects a random word from a predefined list of words and displays the number of letters in the word as underscores.
If the user guesses a letter that is in the word, the corresponding underscores are replaced with the correct letter.
If the user correctly guesses all the letters in the word before the hangman is drawn, they win the game.
